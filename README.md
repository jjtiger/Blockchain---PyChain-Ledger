PyChain Ledger - Can be viewed by clicking the Pychain Streamlit Gif to see an example of a hosted webpage live.  This website has not been published and therefore is not currently live on a host server.  The project description is below. 

As the lead developer on their decentralized finance team.  My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.



Test your complete PyChain ledger and user interface by running your Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your PyChain ledger. Then test the blockchain validation process by using your PyChain ledger. To do so, complete the following steps:


In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded this assignment.


In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by using streamlit run pychain.py.


Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the Add Block button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.


Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit dropdown menu. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the README.md file for your GitHub repository.


Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the README.md file for your homework repository.
